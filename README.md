# PhysicTruck
Free physics based truck game. This project is mainly to familiarise myself with few technologies I think are quite interesting.

##Technologies used
 - [LibGDX, game development framework] (https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)
 - [Box2D, a 2D Physics Engine for Games] (http://box2d.org/)
 - [Universal Tween Engine] (http://www.aurelienribon.com/blog/projects/universal-tween-engine/)  

##Resources
 - [Burnstown Dam Font](http://www.1001fonts.com/burnstown-dam-font.html#character-map)
 - [Free beautiful 2D parallax backgrounds](https://mobilegamegraphics.com/product/free-parallax-backgrounds/)
 
##To-Do
 - There is more work to be done with creating more levels and tweaking the overall look of the game.
 - Finding free or creating appropriate music and sound effects.
 - Adding better control flow and transition between full screen and windowed screen.
 - Check and add other resources to the list if I forgot any.
 
##Issues
 - There is a strange flickering problem in LibGDX while the game is in Windowed mod, Fullscreen option is being considered.
 - Duo to different copyright/licence issues conserning the visual side of the game, some of the spirtes may need to be changed or recrated by me :(.
 - Duo to different copyright/licence issues conserning "free" music/effects around the internet the game still needs proper audio.
